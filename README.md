# Real-time-NER-of-Reddit-Comments
Developed a Python application with Reddit Python SDK to stream subreddit comments and push to Kafka. • Used PySpark’s streaming feature to filter named entities from topic comments using spacy and push to LogStash. • Created dashboard for visualization of the named entities in Kibana to analyze the trends in that subreddit.
